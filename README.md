# Curiosity scraper ðŸ”Ž

A very naif, multi thread Rust application to scrape data from [curiositadalmondo.it](https://curiositadalmondo.it/).

## Usage

To run the application, you need to have Rust installed. 
Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ cargo run
```
The application will download the data and save it in a file called `curiosities.txt`,   
where each curiosity is separated by a newline.

## Why?

Because I can use curiosities to render my terminal a little funnier:

```bash
$ sort -R curiosities.txt | head -n 1 | cowsay | lolcat
```
